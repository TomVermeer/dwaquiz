# clientState

For guarding the state in our applications we will be using Redux, in the following chapters we will first describe te structre of our state and following that the reducers and their respective tasks.

# State overview

### Master app

```js
{
    state: {
        category: {
            allCategories: [string],
            chosenCategories: [numbers], // references index of allCategories,
            categoryValidationFailed: boolean,
        }
        suggestedQuestions: [{category: number, question: string,}], // category references index of allCategories
        scorePerTeam: map(number, {roundPoints: number, correctQuestions: number}), // teamIndex ->; roundpoints, correctquestions
        quizNight :
        {
            askedQuestions: [string],
            teamApplications: [string],
            approvedTeams: [string]
        },
        currentQuestion: {
            isOpen: boolean,
            category: string,
            question: string,
            correctAnswer: string,
            teamAnswers: map(number, {answer: string, isCorrect: boolean}) // teamIndex -> answer, iscorrect
        },
        quizProgress: {
            quizPin: number,
            roundNumber: number,
            questionNumber: number,
        }
    }
}

```

### scoreboard

```js
{
    state: {
        quizProgress: {
            quizPin: number,
            roundNumber: number,
            questionNumber: number,
        },
        participatingTeams: [string],
        currentQuestion: string,
        answeredTeams: [string],
        teamAnswers: map(string, string), // teamname -> answer
        scorePerTeam: map(number, {roundPoints: number, correctQuestions: number})
    }
}
```

### team app

```js
{
    state: {

        quizProgress: {
            quizPin: number,
            roundNumber: number,
            questionNumber: number,
        },
        teamname: string,
        approved: boolean,
        currentQuestion: string,
        answer: string,
        isFirstAnswer: boolean,
        placing: {
            correctQuestions: number,
            roundPoints: number,
            placement: number
        }
    }
}

```

**Waar een map staat wordt een object van key-value pairs bedoeld, geen es6 map.*
